# AI-Powered Closed-Loop Intervention to Promote a Supportive and Interactive Environment around Children

Welcome to the **PCITapp** repository. This project is a demo of our proprietary solution. Due to confidentiality and data privacy, the source code is not available. Instead, we have provided visual representations of the key features below.

---

## Overview

Our demo showcases:
- **Innovative User Experience:** An intuitive interface and seamless workflow.
- **Cutting-Edge Technology:** ASR, Dydaic parent-kid speaker recognition, DPICS coding
- **Real-World Applications:** For a PCI therapist, DPICS is an essential tool to assess, guide, and enhance parent-child interactions. It ensures therapy is data-driven, effective, and tailored to each family's needs. By using DPICS, therapists can provide structured feedback, improve intervention strategies, and ultimately support better parent-child relationships.
