  - [ ] DPICS codes for each of verbal, vocal, or physical behaviors with timestamping 

7. **Output Training Progress Summary Report:**
  - [x] Bar plots comparing critical PCIT skills (e.g., Labeled praise, Direct Commands every 5/10 minutes) between the current session and past sessions  
  - [ ] Gamification Elements: Introduce badges, rewards, or progress bars to celebrate achievements and maintain motivation.
